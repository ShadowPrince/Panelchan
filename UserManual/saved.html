    <p>Welcome to Panelchan!</p>
    <p>This is <b>main screen</b>. Every series that you add end up here, sorted by newest. You can continue to read the series by touching it or edit/delete by holding it.</p>
    <p>The last two buttons are always <i>Add</i> and <i>Settings</i>. With <i>Add</i> you can, no surprises, add another series to the list (adding is kind of an complicated process which will be discussed when you get there). Do I have to tell you what happens if you tap <i>Settings</i>? Everything there should be pretty self-explanatory.</p>
    <p>The list itself consist of thumbnails, names and urls. URLs and thumbnails are updated <b>automatically</b>, titles can be edited on series <i>Edit</i> screen and default to page title. You can check settings to change automatic update behaviour (so you can make fancy thumbnails etc).</p>

    <b>TL/DR:</b> series sorted by newest; check settings for some advanced stuff.
