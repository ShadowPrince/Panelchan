    <p>So, you are finally here. It's pretty straightforward from now on - <b>1 finger tap</b> shows next page, <b>2 finger tap</b> shows/hides status bar (there's also second controls layout in the <i>Settings</i>)</p>
    <p>The <i>Lock</i> captures the position and zoom, and image will revert to that values when you change the page (opposed to using auto-zoom and top-left image position). This is really usefull when you read manga.</p>
    <p><b>TL/DR:</b> tap - next page, 2 finger tap - hide bar, lock icon locks zoom/position for next page.</p>
