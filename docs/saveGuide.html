    <p>Basically everything the app does is press next/previous buttons on the webpage for you. So, to add series you have to point where they are, and that's it. So, to do this, you have to do following things:
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the webpage which displays <b>first page (or first set)</b> of the volume</li>
            <li>Press and hold on button which loads <b>next page / volume</b></li>
            <li>Press and hold on button which loads <b>previous page / volume</b></li>
            <li>Review the name and the image in the bottom left corner</li>
            <li>Press <i>Save</i></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>After setup you can test the config by <i>left/right</i> buttons at the bottom-right of the screen. Both page and image at the bottom should change.</p>
    <p>You can change the name by tapping on it, also you can reset the whole process by pressing big red <i>Reset</i> button.</p>
    <p><i>next/prev selector</i> buttons is more for an advanced use; it gives the ability to set your own jQuery-like selector for next/prev buttons. Only use if you know what this is.</p>
    <p>If nothing happens when you hold the next/prev buttons, or the error message appears after you finished the setup, it may be that the site is not supported. Bad luck. You can contact the developer to add support, but don't expect much.</p>
    <p><b>TL/DR:</b> follow the instructions on the bottom of the page.</p>
